        <img id="my-image" src="images/rlryan_crop2.jpg" alt="a selfie of Robert Liam Ryan." title="A selfie of Robert Liam Ryan.">

        <p id="aboutmelife">Hello, my name is Robert. I am a 1<sup>st</sup> year student of the <em>Interactive Media
                Design</em> program at Algonquin College. I enjoy playing video games and <abbr
                title="Tabletop Roleplaying Games">TTRPGs</abbr> in my free time. I am a proud member of the Canadian
            Forces Naval Reserves, and have been serving in the <abbr title="Canadian Armed Forces">CAF</abbr> for about
            2 years.</p>

        <p id="aboutmeschool">I was previously a student of <em>Computer Science</em> at Wilfrid Laurier University,
            however due to complications from the COVID-19 pandemic I had to drop out. Although I mostly have experience
            in C++ and Python, I hope to gain a greater understanding of <abbr
                title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> in
            order to be able to code my own websites.</p>
