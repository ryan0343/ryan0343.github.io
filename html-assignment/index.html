        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>Hello, my name is Robert. I am a 1<sup>st</sup> year student of the <em>Interactive Media Design</em> program at Algonquin College. I enjoy playing video games and <abbr title="Tabletop Roleplaying Games">TTRPGs</abbr> in my free time. I am a proud member of the Canadian Forces Naval Reserves, and have been serving in the <abbr title="Canadian Armed Forces">CAF</abbr> for about 2 years.</p>
        
        <p>I was previously a student of <em>Computer Science</em> at Wilfrid Laurier University, however due to complications from the COVID-19 pandemic I had to drop out. Although I mostly have experience in C++ and Python, I hope to gain a greater understanding of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> in order to be able to code my own websites.</p>
