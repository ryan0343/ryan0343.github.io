                <h2>Fun Facts about Weird Al's <em>Hardware Store</em></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the fast part of <em>Hardware Store</em>, he sings at a rate of about 4 words per second. For
                        context, Eminem's <em>Rap God</em> is 5 words per second!</li>
                    <li>It is one of Weird Al's original songs. It apparently started out as a parody of another song
                        which Weird Al refuses to share the identity of, his reasoning being that it would end up as a
                        Wikipedia entry.</li>
                    <li>It was released as part of his 2003 album <em>Poodle Hat</em>, which included songs such as
                        <em>Couch Potato</em> and <em>eBay</em>.</li>
                    <li>It is a list song, a style shared by songs such as <em>Mambo no.5</em> and the internet-famous
                        <em>Pokerap</em>.</li>
